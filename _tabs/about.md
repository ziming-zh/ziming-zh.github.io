I'm a junior undergraduate student majoring in *Computer Science* at University of Michigan and *Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)* at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I'm broadly interested in computational science & engineering,  AI system software, and cutting edge AI algorithms in engineering applications.



My primary research focus involves the following:

* AI for computational science
* Systematic AI structure
* Physics-informed Neural Network
* Data-driven fluid flow modeling
