## Main Content

Recently, Ziming Zhou (author), a junior JI undergraduate ECE student, has been announced as a winner of the Internal Combustion Engine Division (ICED) undergraduate research competition at the 2023 ASME Internal Combustion Engine ICE Forward Conference, which was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, between October 8 and 11, 2023. Winners of this undergraduate research competition are selected based on their outstanding research work in the field of internal combustion engines, emissions systems, fuels and sprays, or carbon management. As this year’s recipient, Ziming was invited to deliver his winner’s presentation entitled “Planar In-cylinder Flow Field Prediction based on Physics-inspired Automated Machine Learning Framework” to over 200 leading engine experts and researchers who attended the Award Presentation Ceremony.

Engine efficiency is one of the most important ways to achieve "peak carbon" and "carbon neutrality". The efficiency of combustion engines has received increasing attention from the energy and automotive industries in terms of energy conservation and emission reduction. In terms of fuel-air mixing strategy, non-uniform mixing between fuel and air usually leads to incomplete combustion and increased pollutant generation. Therefore, it is important to understand the mixing mechanism of fuel and air in the cylinder under different operating conditions in order to achieve "fuel reduction".

Ziming Zhou, under the guidance of Prof. David Hung and Postdoctoral Researcher Dr. Fengnian Zhao at UM-SJTU JI, incorporates the spatiotemporal characteristics of flow fields into a machine learning framework, achieving accurate flow field predictions across high, medium, and low swirl ratios within engine cylinders. This research work employed an implicit physics constraint strategy in the model construction process, deeply integrating physical information with the model structure. This approach demonstrated clear advantages in predicting flow fields under complex operating conditions.
