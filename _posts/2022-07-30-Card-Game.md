## Introduction 

My designed game "Card Game" is a project of UM-SJTU JI 2021-2022 Fall course ENGR151, using GTK to offer a GUI-enabled card game. The game is implemented using C/C++ and GUI is supported using GTK extension. 

## Game Elements 

### GUI Card Display empowered by GTK

    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);" 
    src="Card-3.png" alt="Image failed to load">
    <br>
    <div style="color:orange; border-bottom: 1px solid #d9d9d9;
    display: inline-block;
    color: #999;
    padding: 2px;">  Card game GUI </div>
</center>

### Terminal Backends

### Reflection


This project marks several firsts for me â€“ my inaugural semester project, the initial venture into a 1000-line code project, my maiden foray into GUI-enabled programming in C/C++, and the initial utilization of callback functions. While it may appear relatively rudimentary compared to subsequent project designs, I hold it in high regard as it has spurred me to delve into program intricacies and initiate exploration into the underlying functioning of computer systems.
