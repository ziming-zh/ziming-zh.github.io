## Introduction 

There is significant room for improvement in energy conservation and carbon reduction in China's agriculture and rural areas. Promoting energy conservation and carbon reduction in the agricultural and rural sectors is a crucial measure to implement the strategy of rural revitalization and a key pathway to achieving China's "dual carbon" goals. Comprising 49 undergraduate, master's, and doctoral students from 15 colleges, including the International and Public Affairs School, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Antai College of Economics and Management, School of Foreign Languages, and UM-SJTU Joint Institute, this project is led by Assistant Researcher Zhang Jingru, Professor Geng Yong, and Associate Professor Wei Wendong.

Focused on the theme of advancing high-quality green and low-carbon rural revitalization, the project aims to effectively support the development of agriculture, improve farmers' livelihoods, and promote rural ecology towards a green, energy-efficient, emission-reducing, and low-carbon direction. The team conducted in-depth field investigations in rural areas across eight provinces and cities. Through comprehensive research on the current status and challenges faced by rural areas in promoting the dual carbon strategy, the project has put forward targeted recommendations and submitted policy suggestions to contribute to the realization of green and low-carbon rural revitalization. Our team is granted first prize in the 2022 "Knowledge and Action Cup," a social practice competition for university students in Shanghai.

Besides this program, I'm also actively engaged in other forms of volunteering services. I'm the director of "*Yuntuoban* Online Volunteer teaching program. This program lasts 10 months, providing online educational resources to over 1,000 elementary and secondary school students in China. This program has been reported by several mainstream media in China and achieves second prize in student social practice competitions of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I'm also nominated as the advanced individual of student social practice in SJTU.
